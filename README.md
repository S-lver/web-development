# 🌐 Sifiso Mokgata — Creative Developer Portfolio

Live at: [https://s-lver.github.io/web-development/](https://s-lver.github.io/web-development/)

Welcome to my interactive portfolio—a web experience that blends **technical depth** with **creative flair**. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and **Three.js**, this site serves as a living canvas for my experiments in design, development, and deployment.
